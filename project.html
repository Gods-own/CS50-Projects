                    <p class="lineHeight"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">History:</b> Remember that one of the things Idumeka
                    loves doing is learning languages. She is
                    currently learning French, Yoruba and German. So, a little back story, while she was learning Yoruba which is
                    one of the major languages in Nigeria she found out that there are hardly resources and even good applications
                    like Duolingo, Babbel and so on she can use to learn the language; the things that helped her in learning Yoruba
                    are Yoruba movies, Yoruba
                    textbooks and her Yoruba friends. The limitation she faced is  what she doesn't want other people who want to
                    learn the language to face so she has taken it upon herself to develop an application for learning Nigerian
                    languages. She believes Nigeria being a culturally diverse country, aside from fostering unity, the app will
                    be of tremendous benefit in other areas.</p>
                    <p class="lineHeight"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage:</b> She is currently at the stage of making
                    sentences, when she is done is will give a Yoruba expert to translate does sentences</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="text-center">NGO FOCUSED ON INTODUCING PROGRAMMING TO STUDENTS IN NIGERIA</h3>
            <p class="lineHeight"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">History:</b> Technology is moving rapidly and Nigeria is lagging
            behind in comparison with other developed countries. She would like to set up a Non-Governmental Organization to introduce web
            development or any visual programming language like Scratch to kids or students in public secondary school who can barely afford
            good education. Programming is a valuable skill in this day and age, and it would be a huge benefit to introduce it to students
            at an early stage in life who knows who might find their passion from there and eventually become the next Bill Gates, a personâ€™s
            potential is not known until given an opportunity to express their full potential. Imagine if she was introduced to programming
            while she was still in secondary, she wouldn't have wasted five years of her life studying petroleum engineering so this
            project is really important to her.</p>
            <p class="lineHeight"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage:</b>This project is still in it's idea stage as she wants to
            go back to school to study either software development or web and mobile computing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container proj2 mt-5 mb-5">
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="text-center">YOUTUBE CHANNEL</h3>
            <p class="lineHeight"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">History:</b> Life has not really been a bed of roses for Idumeka,
            she wants to start a youtube channel where she can share her stories and inspire people. She wants to inspire people through
            her story. God has been so good to her even in times when she doesn't deserve it. She can't obviously share he story here,
            a vlog would be a much better platform to use. She just wants to let other people who have been through a lot know that they
            are not alone, God is with them every step of the way, He is waiting for them with outstreched arms, He wants them to cast all
            all their burdens on Him. God loves them! She has a lot to say but she will stop right here and leave you with these scriptures;
            1 peter 5:7 which says "casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you." and philipians 4:8 which says
            "do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made
            known to God." You can click <a href="about.html">here</a> to know what she is about or <a href="index.html">here</a> to
            go to the home page.</p>
            <p class="lineHeight"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage:</b>This project is still in it's idea stage as she
            doesn't yet have the courage to do it yet. hopefully before the end of this year she would do it.</p>
