Declare variable height

 Get height from user

  keep prompting the user to input height while height is less than 1 or greater than 8

  Start loop

    for i = 0, perform inner loops height times, each time on a new line, where i is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs

      where the first inner loop prints spaces (g - 1) times for g = height, where g is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs

       and the second inner loop prints # (j + 1) times for j = 0, where j is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs

  End loop

 End program
